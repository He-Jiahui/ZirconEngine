# Runtime370 Extension Report Diagnostic Capacity

`runtime_extension_report` now reserves one diagnostic slot per input registration for both
diagnostic collections. Registration ordering, merge behavior, and the ordering-failure return
path remain unchanged.

The regression coverage checks the capacity contract and merge-order placement. The ignored
Windows Release benchmark emits `RUNTIME370_EXTENSION_REPORT_CAPACITY_BENCH_V1` over 17 paired
samples with 1,024 diagnostic entries per sample and requires
`optimized_p95_ns <= legacy_p95_ns * 0.70`.

No direct Cargo validation was run. The coordinator owns combined Runtime/Editor Release
compilation, regression tests, ignored benchmarks, record finalization, manifest-only commit/push,
and one-shot WeCom publication after measured evidence passes the declared gate.

## Current batched validation handoff (2026-08-30)

Runtime370 is included in ticket `bb793f894807473ea8c78a90c6fc2d35` for request
`runtime-editor-369-371-315-317-20260830-v2`, with source manifest hash
`391c0060104af61c0806431d76bebbaf6f1d74c41c216b63aa899577269baf4c`. The batch also binds
`external_image_copy.rs` at `a1102110c7daee23489c1f19491a267e64f7a0e4a2882fa61e1c1c47920606`.
Cargo, performance, review, commit, push, and WeCom remain coordinator-owned and pending.

## Validation attempt (2026-08-30)

Corrected batch ticket `bb793f894807473ea8c78a90c6fc2d35` ended `failed`. The coordinator
provided no valid Cargo, performance, or commit evidence; the external validation resource was
left unchanged and no successful WeCom notification was sent.
